This app lets you check the daily recipes shared by others so you can find one of your choice, add to bookmark so as not to miss it and try it yourself later. Having tried the recipe out, you can further leave a comment on it, or you can share it to others. If you have enough experience, you can create a recipe of your own and post it so others would try it as well. Your bookmark contains your favorite recipes as long as you need until you delete it as irrelevant. To find the recipe you want, just type what you want on the search prompt bar and see corresponding results.
